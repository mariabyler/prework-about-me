      <h1>Hi! My name is Maria Byler.</h1>
      <p>I am a teacher turned web developer student.</p>
      <h1>I live in Brevard, NC.</h1>
      <p>Brevard is in Western North Carolina, in the beautiful Appalachian Mountains.</p>
      <h1>When I'm not working or watching makers on Youtube, you can find me reading or weaving.</h1>
      <p>(Ask me about a book recommendation sometime.)</p>
      <h1>My dream job is anywhere I can do fulfilling work that has definable goals.</h1>
      <p>The work itself does not matter much. But it has to be something where I can constantly learn and grow. </p>
      <h1>Western North Carolina is home to me.</h1>
      <p>If you're really from WNC, you'll make to clarify the "Western".</p>
      <h1>I want to be a web developer because it so broadly applicable in so many different areas.</h1>
      <p>Web Developers work with most every field, and I find that exciting!</p>
